About Us

As fellow pet owners, we all love our pets and would do anything for them. Sadly, on occasion pets have been known to run away, or get lost during terrible natural disasters. In repsonse, we founded a web application that would allow us to connect with those whom have lost or found pets.

# Vision

Find My Paws is a dynamic web application,functioning as a virtual bulletin board dedicated for users to post information, search for, and find their lost pets.

It is free and humanitarian!
Our genuine mission is to find lost pets and reunite them with their owners.
There are some web applications that have similar ideas:
